			CONFIGURATIONS
			/============/

Welcome to configurations. This is a small script which uses
git to make it easy to manage your configurations in your home.

You will now be asked if a file or a directory already exists
in your home. Symlinks will sliently be DELETED.

If you choose to overwrite the file/directory which is already
in your home, then a backup will be written to ~/OLD.

The directory ~/OLD will be created if its non-existent.

Probably you can delete ~/OLD, if you don't need the files later on.
