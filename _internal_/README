			Configurations
			/============/

  This is a set of configuration examples managed in a git tree, to ease
branching. Since you will most likely create your own configurations based on
the examples, its intended to create a branch for your local configurations.

  Mostly it includes configurations for VIM and Zsh. Most of the configuration
is written and documented, but if you see something which is not quite well
documented, you are always free to contact me.
