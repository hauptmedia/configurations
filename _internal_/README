			Configurations
			/============/

  This is a set of configuration files managed in a git tree, to ease
branching. Since you will most likely create your own configurations based on
these files, it is intended to create a branch for your local configurations.

  It includes configurations for different programs but the biggest parts are
the Configurations for zsh and vim. There are also some utilities like
build_kernel which is very useful to build large amounts of linux-kernel for
different debian systems.

  There is a simple Makefile (for GNU Make) which can be used to install the
symlinks by just typing "make" and there is a update-configurations script
which can be called to pull in changes from the upstream.

			What about GIT
			/============/

  Git is a very nice SCM which provides many nice features like very easy
branching, merging, cloning and so on... far to much to describe in this file.
There are some simple git commands you should know to use these collections of
configuration files.

  An example:

	$ mkdir -p $HOME/devel/git; cd $HOME/devel/git
	$ git clone git://www.dreamind.de/files/scm/configurations-0.1.git configurations
	$ cd configurations
	$ make

  Answer everything with 'y'

	$ ls -la $HOME/OLD

  Decide what to save or just delete the old stuff

	$ rm -ri $HOME/OLD

  Now you have cloned everything and installed symlinks in your home
directory. The git clone command has created a local git repository which has
two branches, one is named master and one is named origin. The first one is
the default branch and is your own master. You can make your personal changes
here and pull in upstream changes (see link below).

  If you plan to make your changes public it is recommended to separate
personal changes and generic changes. Put everything in your master branch and
if you change for example "zsh/07_email" put it in a personal branch.
